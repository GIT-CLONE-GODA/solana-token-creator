# üîí Security Guidelines

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Security ‚úÖ

- [ ] **No hardcoded tokens in source code**
  - Check `app.js` for any `GITHUB_TOKEN` references
  - Verify no private keys in any files
  - Confirm no wallet addresses hardcoded

- [ ] **Repository secrets configured**
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` stored as repository secret
  - No sensitive data in environment variables section
  - Secrets have appropriate access levels

- [ ] **Gitignore properly configured**
  - `config.js` ignored
  - `*.key` and `*-keypair.json` ignored
  - `.env*` files ignored
  - `wallet.json` ignored

- [ ] **GitHub repository settings**
  - Branch protection enabled
  - Actions permissions set to "Read and write"
  - Dependabot alerts enabled
  - Security advisories enabled

### Runtime Security ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Wallet security**
  - Using separate wallets for dev/prod
  - Phantom wallet properly configured
  - Private keys never shared or logged
  - Wallet permissions reviewed

- [ ] **Network security**
  - Testing on devnet before mainnet
  - Network endpoints are official Solana RPCs
  - Transaction fees monitored
  - Rate limiting considered

- [ ] **GitHub Actions security**
  - Workflow permissions minimal
  - No secrets logged in outputs
  - Artifacts properly secured
  - Workflow runs monitored

### Post-Deployment Security ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Monitoring**
  - GitHub Actions usage tracked
  - Failed workflows investigated
  - Unusual activity monitored
  - Security alerts reviewed

- [ ] **Maintenance**
  - Dependencies updated regularly
  - Security patches applied
  - Access permissions reviewed
  - Backup procedures in place

## Sensitive Data Identification

### üö® Critical Secrets (Never expose)

1. **GitHub Personal Access Token**
   - Location: Repository secrets only
   - Purpose: Trigger GitHub Actions
   - Risk: Full repository access

2. **Solana Private Keys**
   - Location: Generated during workflow
   - Purpose: Token creation transactions
   - Risk: Wallet compromise

3. **Wallet Keypairs**
   - Location: Temporary workflow files
   - Purpose: Transaction signing
   - Risk: Asset theft

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Sensitive Configuration

1. **GitHub Repository Information**
   - Username and repository name
   - Should be configurable, not hardcoded
   - Low risk but should be parameterized

2. **Network Endpoints**
   - Solana RPC URLs
   - Should use official endpoints
   - Risk: Man-in-the-middle attacks

3. **Wallet Addresses**
   - Public keys are safe to expose
   - Private keys must never be exposed
   - Risk: Privacy concerns only

## Security Best Practices

### Code Security

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Using configuration
const GITHUB_OWNER = CONFIG.GITHUB_OWNER;

// ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded values
const GITHUB_TOKEN = 'ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx';
```

### Environment Security

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Using environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_TOKEN"

# ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded in scripts
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### Workflow Security

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Good: Using secrets
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded tokens
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Incident Response

### If Secrets Are Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Revoke compromised tokens immediately
   - Change all related passwords
   - Review access logs
   - Notify team members

2. **Investigation**
   - Identify scope of compromise
   - Check for unauthorized access
   - Review recent activities
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Generate new tokens
   - Update repository secrets
   - Test functionality
   - Monitor for issues

4. **Prevention**
   - Review security practices
   - Update procedures
   - Additional monitoring
   - Team training

### If Wallet Is Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Transfer assets to secure wallet
   - Revoke all permissions
   - Disconnect from all dApps
   - Generate new wallet

2. **Investigation**
   - Review transaction history
   - Identify attack vector
   - Check for malware
   - Document timeline

3. **Recovery**
   - Create new secure wallet
   - Update configurations
   - Test with small amounts
   - Monitor transactions

## Security Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools

1. **GitHub Security Features**
   - Dependabot
   - Security advisories
   - Secret scanning
   - Code scanning

2. **Wallet Security**
   - Hardware wallets for production
   - Multi-signature wallets
   - Regular security audits
   - Backup procedures

3. **Monitoring Tools**
   - GitHub Actions logs
   - Solana Explorer
   - Network monitoring
   - Alert systems
